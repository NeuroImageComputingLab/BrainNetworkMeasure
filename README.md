# BrainNetworkMeasure

Different aspects of local and global brain connectivity are characterized
by brain network measures, which are classified as nodal and global
measures. We present novel definitions for group nodes
network measures here, to solve a number of such group-context
problems in brain networks analysis. We apply the group measures to
the structural connectomes of older-adults and Alzheimer's disease (AD)
subjects based on the brain lobes and hemispherical groups. A number
of significant clinical findings have been reported here, which has not
been explicitly explored previously. The temporal and parietal lobes are
the most central lobes in older-adults but the strength of these lobes has
been heavily affected in AD. Leftward efficiency revealed in older-adults
and the asymmetry disappeared in the rewired AD. We prove that the
concepts of group measures have the potential to solve several such
problems in the brain networks analysis and the group measures change
the way of network analysis.
