# BrainNetworkMeasure

Different aspects of local and global brain connectivity are characterized
by brain network measures, which are classified as nodal and global
measures. The nodal measures, such as centrality measures, are defined
for a single node of the network, and the global measures, such as
efficiency measures, are defined for the whole brain. But a meaningful
group of nodes will be benefited from a formulation that applies to a
group of nodes rather than a single node or whole brain. The question
like ``which brain-lobe is more structurally central in the older-adult
brain?" could be answered to some extent by the application of a
centrality measure that applied to the group of nodes from each lobe. In
the brain asymmetric studies, path-based global measures were applied
to the left and right hemispherical networks separately, considering only
intra-hemispheric edges. However, for a valid comparison, such global
measures should include the inter-hemispheric edges as well. This
problem can be solved by considering both hemispherical nodes as two
groups in one network. We present novel definitions for group nodes
network measures here, to solve a number of such group-context
problems in brain networks analysis. We apply the group measures to
the structural connectomes of older-adults and Alzheimer's disease (AD)
subjects based on the brain lobes and hemispherical groups. A number
of significant clinical findings have been reported here, which has not
been explicitly explored previously. The temporal and parietal lobes are
the most central lobes in older-adults but the strength of these lobes has
been heavily affected in AD. Leftward efficiency revealed in older-adults
and the asymmetry disappeared in the rewired AD. We prove that the
concepts of group measures have the potential to solve several such
problems in the brain networks analysis and the group measures change
the way of network analysis.
